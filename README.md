# text-helper

It's a Chrome extension that bolds the first two letters of each word to help my
eyes not jump everywhere. You can use it if you want, but I made it in 15
minutes so don't expect it to not break things.

Steps to add to Chrome

1. Clone/download (obv)
2. Enable developer mode on the extensions page,
3. Click "load unpacked"
4. And select the folder you downloaded it to.
